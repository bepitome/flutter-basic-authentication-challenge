### What is Saqal?

Saqal is an open-source organization to guide less experience developers through real-life challenges. Currently, we focus only on Flutter framework.

### Why should I complete Saqal challenges?

Saqal challenges provide unique experience as they’re designed to fill untouched gaps by anyone at anywhere.
